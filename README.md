# Project objective :
## Explore at least five supervised models from the list below, to make a forecast of the target variable Display (Y) using as independent variables X1...X7.Of the proposed models, at least two approaches based on a Datamart with nominal features - consider discretizing the continuous variables intelligently (MDLPC)
- **Logistic Regression**

- **k-nearest neighbors**

- **Decision tree**

- **Adaboost (adaptive boosting)**

- **Random Forest**

- **ADL model**
